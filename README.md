## Easy Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe (Three in a Row) game implemented in Java. It allows two players to take turns making their moves on a 3x3 board. The game continues until one of the players wins or there is a draw.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources.
  - `tictac/`: Contains the Java classes for the game.
    - `Board.java`: Represents the game board.
    - `TicTacToeGame.java`: Main logic of the game.
    - `MainApp.java`: Main class for running the game.

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies.

- `Test`: Folder where there are the tests of the classes.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Execution Instructions

1. Run the `MainApp` class.
2. Follow the instructions on the console to input the rows and columns where you want to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').
3. Continue playing until one of the players wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure you have a Java development environment set up.
- This game follows the classic rules of Tic Tac Toe, where the win condition is having three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
